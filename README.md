# ENABLE

This repository contains the code for the ENABLE interface written in VBA for Excel.
This tool digitally manages patient tumor measurement data which is exported from our PACS (VuePacs, Carestream).

Currently, our ability to upload a data model to a database is compatible with the commercially available Labmatrix database - we utilize a custom made patient form in Labmatrix which can accept patient tumor data.
